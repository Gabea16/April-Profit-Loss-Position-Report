# April-Profit-Loss-Position-Report

## This Excel sheet includes a Profit and Loss/Position Report for my April Waha Balmo position. In my Energy Trading Strategies class, we traded (fake) Swing Swaps with each other. We took a view on the market, and effectively executed that view by speculating on where the Balmo would be through Swing Swaps. We started this project aorund the same time the tarriff issues started hammering the market and crude was being driven down. This created a very bull market for Waha, rewarding those with long positions. Although my view on the market was very off due to this unforseen event, I still learned how to create a profit and loss/position report.
